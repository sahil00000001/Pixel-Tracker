- **Minimal Storage**: In-memory storage with unique tracking IDs

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/pixel/create` - Creates unique tracking pixel with embed code
- `GET /api/pixel/:id` - Serves 1x1 transparent GIF and marks pixel as opened
- `POST /api/pixel/check` - Checks if a specific pixel has been opened
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Returns stats and recent pixel activity
- `GET /api-docs` - Comprehensive API documentation for developers

### Frontend Features

- **Web Interface**: `/api-docs` route serves formatted documentation
- **Features**: Detailed examples in JavaScript, Python, PHP, and cURL
- **Advanced Use Cases**: Campaign tracking, A/B testing, real-time monitoring
- **Integration Examples**: Ready-to-use code snippets for popular platforms

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution with auto-restart
- **Storage**: In-memory storage for immediate testing

### Production
- **Frontend**: Static build served from `/dist/public`
- **Backend**: Express server serving API and static files
- **Environment**: Works out of the box without external dependencies
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Auto-detects hosting environment (Replit, Render, Vercel, Railway) for correct URL generation

### Tracking Implementation
- 1x1 transparent GIF pixel tracking
- Unique UUID generation for each pixel
- Advanced time tracking with view count and duration
- Real-time status updates via in-memory storage
- Console logging for tracking events
- Session-based viewing time calculation (30-second timeout)
